At this step, pay special attention to intangible costs and indirect benefits that are easily overlooked.</p> </li> <li> <p>Step Three: Monetize Costs and Benefits     This is the most challenging step in CBA. You need to assign a reasonable monetary value to each cost and benefit on the list. For direct costs and benefits, this is relatively easy.

This suggests that effective problem-solving in a modern context is not merely a technical exercise but a comprehensive, interdisciplinary capability highly dependent on soft skills. Successful problem-solving processes are not just about finding answers but about the entire process of inquiry, analysis, collaboration, and adaptation, requiring a blend of cognitive (analytical, critical thinking), interpersonal (communication, collaboration), and emotional (overcoming fear, managing frustration) skills.

Human Performance Variation Analysis is classified as a method of human performance problem-solving and variation analysis [1]. Other literature explicitly states that it is a \"systematic root cause analysis process\" applied to \"human performance issues\" [16]. Some literature even mentions that human performance issues \"require the same detailed examination and attention as problems in other fields\" [17]. This highlights the recognition that while general root cause analysis techniques (like Five Whys or Fishbone Diagrams) are powerful, human performance issues often have unique complexities that require specialized frameworks. HPVA acknowledges that human behavior is not random but influenced by systemic factors, and thus, performance variations can be scientifically analyzed and addressed. This bridges the gap between organizational psychology and operational efficiency, emphasizing that the human element is a critical component of any system, requiring specialized analytical tools for effective problem-solving.</p>"},{"location":"en/Problem%20Solving%20%26%20Decision%20Making/problem_solving/Problem-Solving-en/#45-management-problem-solving","title":"4.5.

This indicates that management problem-solving goes beyond addressing immediate issues; it actively adapts to market changes and competitive landscapes. Effective management problem-solving relies less on rigid formulas and more on strategic agility and the ability to diagnose problems within a broader organizational and competitive context. The inclusion of tools like the Six Thinking Hats emphasizes the need for diverse perspectives and creative thinking, moving beyond purely analytical approaches.

The inquiry and analysis method initially emphasized the importance of systematic evidence and data [1]. However, this tutorial will introduce methods such as appreciative inquiry (positive psychology), design thinking (empathy, user-centered), collaborative problem-solving (team dynamics, communication), and human performance variation analysis (human performance root causes). Management problem-solving also includes techniques like the Six Thinking Hats (creativity, emotion), as well as analytical tools (SWOT, gap analysis) [2]. This indicates that modern problem-solving is moving beyond purely logical, quantitative, or technical approaches. There is a clear convergence and integration between analytical methods and human-centered and collaborative strategies. This reflects an understanding that many complex problems are socio-technical in nature, requiring both rigorous analysis of data/systems and a deep understanding of human behavior, motivation, and collaboration. The most effective problem-solvers are those who can fluently navigate both domains and integrate their insights. This holistic perspective is crucial for addressing the multifaceted challenges of the 21st century.</p> <p>Problem-solving is a continuous learning and adaptation process for individuals and organizations. In the \"Implementing Solutions\" section, research emphasizes \"evaluating results\" and \"continuous improvement,\" even including repeating the process if goals are not met [8]. Other research indicates that collaborative problem-solving provides team members with opportunities to \"learn from each other's expertise\" and \"develop new skills\" [11]. Furthermore, the literature emphasizes that effective managers must \"deal with new situations\" and that \"the dominant theme today is change\u2014and the speed of change\" [2]. This suggests that problem-solving is not just a task to be completed but a fundamental mechanism for individual and organizational learning and adaptation. Every problem solved or even attempted provides valuable feedback, deepening understanding, improving processes, and building capabilities for future challenges. This continuous learning loop is crucial for maintaining resilience and sustained success in dynamic environments, positioning problem-solving as a core organizational capability rather than just a set of discrete tools. It highlights the importance of cultivating a \"growth mindset\" at both individual and collective levels.</p> <ol> <li>Inquiry &amp; Analysis/Judging - Problem Solving Toolbox - LibGuides at ..., accessed June 28, 2025, https://libguides.bellevue.edu/c.php?g=148652&amp;p=973476</li> <li>Effective Problem-Solving Techniques in Business, accessed June 28, 2025, https://business.purdue.edu/master-of-business/online-masters-in-business-administration/posts/problem-solving-techniques-in-business.php</li> <li>What Is Appreciative Inquiry?

Kanban, a term derived from the Japanese word for \"signal board,\" is a powerful, intuitive visual workflow management method designed to solve these problems. It is not a rigid framework like Scrum that prescribes roles and events, but a more flexible Agile practice and mindset focused on optimizing the efficiency of value flow.</p> <p>The core of the Kanban method is to make previously invisible workflows and tasks clear and completely transparent through a Kanban Board. Then, by limiting Work in Progress (WIP) and establishing a clear Pull System, it systematically identifies and eliminates bottlenecks in the process, allowing value to flow faster, smoother, and more predictably from \"to-do\" to \"done.\" It aims to create a stable, sustainable work rhythm, preventing teams from falling into chaos and inefficiency due to task overload.</p>"},{"location":"en/Product%20%26%20User/product_development/Kanban-Tutorial-en/#the-six-core-practices-of-the-kanban-method","title":"The Six Core Practices of the Kanban Method","text":"<p>Kanban's success relies on the continuous application of the following six core practices.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Visualize the Workflow: This is the starting point of Kanban. You need to work with your team to map out all steps of work from start to finish (e.g., \"To Do,\" \"Designing,\" \"Developing,\" \"Testing,\" \"Done\") on a whiteboard or electronic Kanban board, and represent each work item (e.g., a user story, a bug) as a card on the board.</p> </li> <li> <p>Limit Work in Progress (WIP): This is the soul of Kanban. For each or some steps in the process, set a clear upper limit on the number of tasks allowed to be in progress simultaneously. For example, specify that the \"Developing\" column can have a maximum of 3 cards. When this column is full, no one can \"pull\" new work from the previous step until a current work item is completed and moved out. Limiting WIP fundamentally prevents task accumulation, exposes process bottlenecks, and creates a focused work environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Manage Flow: The goal of Kanban is to maximize the speed and smoothness of value flow. You need to continuously monitor the flow of work items on the board, identify where they get stuck the longest (i.e., bottlenecks), and then concentrate the team's efforts on resolving these bottlenecks to make the entire system flow smoothly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Make Process Policies Explicit: Make the team's work rules clear and transparent. For example, clearly define what constitutes \"Done\" (Definition of Done)? What are the WIP limits for each swimlane? How is task priority determined? Clear rules are the foundation for the team to work autonomously and coordinately.</p> </li> <li> <p>Implement Feedback Loops: Kanban encourages establishing feedback loops at various rhythms. For example, daily team stand-ups (for synchronizing daily work), regular Kanban review meetings (for reviewing and optimizing processes), and customer delivery review meetings.</p> </li> <li> <p>Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally: Kanban is a method that encourages \"starting from where you are now and evolving continuously.\" It does not require you to make disruptive organizational changes. The team should continuously and collaboratively make small, experimental improvements to its workflow based on data and shared understanding.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"en/Product%20%26%20User/product_development/Kanban-Tutorial-en/#kanban-board-structure-example","title":"Kanban Board Structure Example","text":"<ul> <li>Workflow: A card (representing a task) moves from left to right, passing through each stage.

Extremely high brand loyalty, vast global distribution networks, and huge advertising investments constitute insurmountable barriers for newcomers.</li> <li>Threat of Substitutes: Medium to Strong. Water, juice, tea, coffee, etc., are all substitutes, and consumers have many choices.</li> <li>Bargaining Power of Suppliers: Weak. Raw materials such as sugar, water, and packaging cans are commodities, and suppliers are dispersed and have no bargaining power.</li> <li>Bargaining Power of Buyers: Medium. For individual end consumers, bargaining power is zero. But for large retailers (e.g., Walmart, Carrefour) and catering channels, they have strong bargaining power.</li> <li>Conclusion: The industry structure is very attractive, and the two giants have effectively resisted the pressure from new entrants and suppliers by building strong brand and distribution barriers, thereby achieving sustained high profits.</li> </ul> <p>Case 2: Personal Computer (PC) Industry</p> <ul> <li>Rivalry Among Existing Competitors: Extremely Intense.

As competitors increase, the market becomes extremely crowded, and the space for profit and growth shrinks, this ocean is \"stained\" red by fierce competition. Blue Ocean Strategy offers a completely different path; it does not advocate bloody head-on competition with rivals in the red ocean, but rather aims to create new, uncontested \"blue ocean\" market space, thereby making competition irrelevant.</p> <p>The core of Blue Ocean Strategy is not technological innovation itself, but a strategic logic called Value Innovation. Value innovation is the intersection where companies achieve \"having their cake and eating it too\" by simultaneously pursuing the seemingly contradictory goals of differentiation and low cost. It is not about making trade-offs between existing value and cost, but rather breaking this trade-off to create a leap in value for both customers and the company itself. By reconstructing industry elements, Blue Ocean Strategy aims to provide customers with a new, distinctive value, thereby opening up an unprecedented vast market.</p>"},{"location":"en/Strategy%20%26%20Business/strategic_execution/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Tutorial-en/#core-analytical-tools-of-blue-ocean-strategy","title":"Core Analytical Tools of Blue Ocean Strategy","text":"<p>Blue Ocean Strategy provides a set of systematic analytical tools to help companies systematically think about how to escape the red ocean and create a blue ocean.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Strategy Canvas     This is a powerful diagnostic and action framework.
