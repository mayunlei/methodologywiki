# ORID Focused Conversation Method

In team meetings or debriefing discussions, we often encounter the dilemma where discussions quickly devolve into arguments over solutions, or become a "one-man show" by a few individuals, while many remain silent, leading to meetings that neither reach consensus nor generate true deep thinking. The **ORID Focused Conversation Method** is a powerful and elegant **structured facilitation technique** designed to solve this problem. It systematically guides a discussion through four logically progressive levels, ensuring that the team moves from **objective facts** to **subjective feelings**, then to **interpretive analysis**, and finally to **informed decisions**.

ORID is an acronym for four levels, simulating the natural process of the human brain processing information and forming decisions:

*   **O - Objective**: About facts and data.
*   **R - Reflective**: About internal reactions and emotions.
*   **I - Interpretive**: About meaning, value, and significance.
*   **D - Decisional**: About future actions and resolutions.

By strictly following this "O-R-I-D" sequence in designing and guiding questions, the facilitator can ensure that every participant thinks on the same "channel," avoiding chaotic clashes of different thought levels. It creates a safe, in-depth discussion space, allowing the team's collective wisdom to truly emerge.

## Detailed Explanation of the Four Levels of ORID

The four levels of ORID, like a funnel, guide the discussion from the concrete, objective external world, gradually deepening into the abstract, profound inner world, and finally returning to concrete future actions.

## How to Design and Facilitate an ORID Discussion

Successfully applying ORID hinges on the facilitator's ability to design a series of precise, open-ended, and logical questions for each level.

1.  **Step One: Preparation Phase**
    *   **Clarify Discussion Focus**: Clearly define the core topic of this ORID discussion. For example, "Debriefing our 'Dolphin' project from last quarter."
    *   **Design ORID Questions**: Prepare your list of guiding questions in advance for each of the four levels. Prepare at least 2-3 questions for each level.

2.  **Step Two: O - Objective Level: Establish a Common Factual Basis**
    *   **Purpose**: To ensure all participants start from the same objective, undisputed factual point. This step aims to "clear the mind" and eliminate subjective assumptions.
    *   **Guiding Question Examples**:
        *   "When we look back at the 'Dolphin' project, what specific data or facts did you see?"
        *   "Please recall, during the project, what was the most memorable sentence or scene for you?"
        *   "If we look at the project timeline, what key event nodes occurred?"

3.  **Step Three: R - Reflective Level: Connect Personal Inner Experiences**
    *   **Purpose**: To provide a safe space for the team's emotions and intuitive feelings to be expressed, based on facts. This step helps build team trust and psychological safety.
    *   **Guiding Question Examples**:
        *   "At what stage of the project did you feel most energized or excited?"
        *   "What moment made you feel most anxious, frustrated, or confused?"
        *   "What was your first reaction when you heard the final customer feedback?"

4.  **Step Four: I - Interpretive Level: Uncover Deeper Meaning and Insights**
    *   **Purpose**: This is the "value sublimation" stage of the discussion. Guide the team to extract deeper meanings, patterns, and key learnings from facts and feelings.
    *   **Guiding Question Examples**:
        *   "What is the most important value and meaning of this project's success (or failure) for our team?"
        *   "What is the most valuable lesson we learned from this?"
        *   "How did this project change our understanding of 'customer needs'?"

5.  **Step Five: D - Decisional Level: Form Clear Future Actions**
    *   **Purpose**: To translate all previous discussions into concrete, actionable future steps or resolutions, ensuring the meeting produces practical outcomes.
    *   **Guiding Question Examples**:
        *   "Based on our discussion today, what is the first and most important change we need to make to make our next project more successful?"
        *   "What should we start doing immediately? Stop doing? Continue doing?"
        *   "Regarding the next steps, who is responsible? What is the deadline?"

## Application Cases

**Case 1: Project Retrospective Meeting**

*   **Focus**: Debriefing a recently completed complex project with both successes and failures.
*   **ORID Application**:
    *   **O**: "Let's first review the project data: How long was the final delivery delayed compared to the original plan? How much was the budget overspent? What was the user activity metric?"
    *   **R**: "During the week when the project was most severely delayed, what was the general feeling among everyone?"
    *   **I**: "What was the most important lesson we learned about 'cross-departmental communication' from this delay?"
    *   **D**: "To avoid similar problems in the future, we decided that in all cross-departmental projects, a clear RACI matrix must be established at the initiation stage. This will be handled by the Project Management Office and completed by the end of the next quarter."

**Case 2: Team Learning Sharing Session After Reading a Book**

*   **Focus**: Team members share learnings after jointly reading "The Lean Startup."
*   **ORID Application**:
    *   **O**: "What was the most impressive concept, story, or sentence in the book for you?"
    *   **R**: "When you read about the concept of 'MVP,' what failed product of our own did you associate it with? How did you feel at that time?"
    *   **I**: "What is the biggest inspiration and challenge of the book's core ideas for our current product development process?"
    *   **D**: "We decided to try a 'landing page MVP' experiment for the next new feature development. Product Manager Xiao Wang will be responsible for launching it within two weeks."

**Case 3: Mediation Meeting After a Team Conflict**

*   **Focus**: Helping two colleagues who had a conflict due to work disagreements engage in an open, constructive dialogue.
*   **ORID Application**:
    *   **O**: The facilitator guides both parties to objectively state, "What exactly happened in yesterday afternoon's meeting? What did you say? What did he say?" (State only facts, without judgment).
    *   **R**: "How did you feel internally when you heard the other person say that? (Did you feel wronged, misunderstood, angry?)"
    *   **I**: "What do you think are the truly important but unarticulated needs behind this conflict? What does this mean for your future working relationship?"
    *   **D**: "What behavioral change are you both willing to commit to jointly for more effective future collaboration?"

## Advantages and Challenges of ORID

**Core Advantages**

*   **Enhances Meeting Depth and Quality**: Through structured facilitation, ensures discussions delve deeper, reaching the core issues.
*   **Ensures Full Participation**: The design of the four levels, especially O and R, provides safe and easy opportunities for less vocal or introverted members to speak.
*   **Builds Team Consensus**: Starting from a common factual basis and gradually moving towards a shared decision greatly promotes team consensus building.
*   **Highly Versatile**: Can be applied to almost any scenario requiring in-depth dialogue, such as project retrospectives, strategic discussions, team building, and training sharing.

**Potential Challenges**

*   **High Demands on Facilitator**: The success of ORID heavily relies on the facilitator's proficiency in the process and careful design of questioning techniques. A good facilitator is the soul of an ORID discussion.
*   **Time-Consuming**: An in-depth ORID discussion requires ample time and is not suitable for situations requiring quick, urgent decisions.
*   **Requires Participant Commitment**: Requires all participants to be willing to follow the structure and engage in open, honest sharing.

## Extensions and Connections

*   **Action Research**: ORID is an extremely effective practical tool for the "**Reflect**" stage in action research.
*   **Appreciative Inquiry**: ORID can be combined with the principles of Appreciative Inquiry by designing positive ORID questions focused on strengths and successful experiences to guide a positive, empowering discussion.
