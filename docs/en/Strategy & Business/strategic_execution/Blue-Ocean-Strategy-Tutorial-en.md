# Blue Ocean Strategy

In the business world, the vast majority of companies are fighting in a "**red ocean**." A red ocean represents all currently known market space, where industry boundaries are clear, rules of the game are defined, and companies try to grab more limited market share by beating competitors. As competitors increase, the market becomes extremely crowded, and the space for profit and growth shrinks, this ocean is "stained" red by fierce competition. **Blue Ocean Strategy** offers a completely different path; it does not advocate bloody head-on competition with rivals in the red ocean, but rather aims to **create new, uncontested "blue ocean" market space, thereby making competition irrelevant**.

The core of Blue Ocean Strategy is not technological innovation itself, but a strategic logic called **Value Innovation**. Value innovation is the intersection where companies achieve "having their cake and eating it too" by simultaneously pursuing the seemingly contradictory goals of **differentiation** and **low cost**. It is not about making trade-offs between existing value and cost, but rather breaking this trade-off to create a leap in value for both customers and the company itself. By reconstructing industry elements, Blue Ocean Strategy aims to provide customers with a new, distinctive value, thereby opening up an unprecedented vast market.

## Core Analytical Tools of Blue Ocean Strategy

Blue Ocean Strategy provides a set of systematic analytical tools to help companies systematically think about how to escape the red ocean and create a blue ocean.

1.  **Strategy Canvas**
    This is a powerful diagnostic and action framework. It visually depicts, through a single chart, on which competitive factors all competitors in a known market space are investing, and what customers are getting from it. The horizontal axis lists the key factors of competition and investment within the industry, while the vertical axis reflects the level of value companies provide to customers on each factor. By drawing the "value curves" of competitors and oneself, companies can clearly see the competitive landscape of the industry and their own strategic profile.

2.  **Four Actions Framework**
    This is the core thinking tool for breaking the "differentiation-cost" trade-off and reconstructing the value curve. It challenges the long-standing entrenched strategic logic and business model of an industry by asking four key questions:

    *   "Eliminate" and "Reduce" help companies lower their cost structure.
    *   "Raise" and "Create" aim to enhance customer value and create new demand.

## How to Create a Blue Ocean

1.  **Examine the Current Competitive Landscape**
    Draw the strategy canvas of your industry. Clearly list the main competitive elements of the current industry, and objectively evaluate the investment levels of major competitors and yourself on these elements, forming their respective value curves.

2.  **Use the Four Actions Framework to Challenge the Status Quo**
    Systematically apply the "Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create" framework to deconstruct and reconstruct existing competitive elements and customer value. In this step, the key is to dare to challenge industry's "taken-for-granted" rules and assumptions.

3.  **Build a New Value Curve**
    Based on the insights from the Four Actions Framework, build a new, distinctive value curve. An effective blue ocean strategy value curve typically has three distinct characteristics:
    *   **Focus**: The strategy clearly focuses on a few core elements.
    *   **Divergence**: The shape of the value curve is distinctly different from other competitors in the industry.
    *   **Compelling Tagline**: Able to communicate its unique value proposition to the market in simple, powerful language.

4.  **Commercialize the Blue Ocean Idea**
    Ensure that your blue ocean idea can be transformed into a viable, profitable business model. This includes considering pricing, cost structure, and partners to ensure the sustainability of the strategy.

## Classic Application Cases

**Case 1: Cirque du Soleil**

*   **Background**: The traditional circus industry (red ocean) was facing multiple pressures such as an aging audience, the rise of animal rights activism, and diversification of entertainment options, leading to its decline.
*   **Blue Ocean Strategy**: Cirque du Soleil did not compete within the framework of traditional circus but created a new market through value innovation.
    *   **Eliminate**: High-cost elements such as animal acts, star performers, and three-ring circus tents.
    *   **Reduce**: Concession stand hawking and some low-brow humor.
    *   **Raise**: The uniqueness of a single theme, the comfort and artistic sense of the venue.
    *   **Create**: A new narrative performance form that integrates theater, dance, music, and circus arts.
*   **Result**: Cirque du Soleil created a new market, attracting adult audiences who would typically attend operas or ballets, and its ticket prices were much higher than traditional circuses, thereby achieving both differentiation and low cost.

**Case 2: Nintendo Wii Console**

*   **Background**: In the early 21st century console market, Sony (PlayStation) and Microsoft (Xbox) were engaged in an intense "arms race" over graphics processing power, computing speed, and game complexity.
*   **Blue Ocean Strategy**: Nintendo did not join this red ocean competition but found a different path.
    *   **Eliminate/Reduce**: The pursuit of top-tier HD graphics and computing speed, and complex controller designs.
    *   **Increase/Create**: Created a new, intuitive way of gaming based on motion sensing and motion capture, and simple, easy-to-learn controllers. It emphasized the social fun of family entertainment and full-body movement.
*   **Result**: The Wii attracted a large number of users who had never played games before, including children, women, and the elderly, creating a major sales miracle in console history.

**Case 3: Yellow Tail Wine**

*   **Background**: The US wine market was divided into two camps: on one end, cheap table wines of low quality; on the other, expensive, complex fine wines, whose complex terminology and tasting rules intimidated ordinary consumers.
*   **Blue Ocean Strategy**: Yellow Tail aimed to create a fun, uncomplicated wine that ordinary people could easily enjoy.
    *   **Eliminate/Reduce**: Complex winemaking terminology, aging potential, oak barrel flavors, and other intimidating traditional wine marketing elements.
    *   **Increase/Create**: Created an easy-drinking fruity taste, easily recognizable packaging (kangaroo logo), and the convenience of being easily purchased in ordinary supermarkets.
*   **Result**: Yellow Tail quickly became the number one imported wine brand in the US, it attracted consumers who typically drank beer or cocktails, successfully converting "non-wine drinkers" into its customers.

## Value and Challenges of Blue Ocean Strategy

**Core Value**

*   **Escaping Zero-Sum Game**: By creating new demand, companies can achieve rapid growth without direct competition for a period.
*   **Reshaping Industry Boundaries**: A successful blue ocean strategy can change the rules of competition in an industry, or even create an entirely new industry.
*   **Building Strong Brands**: As pioneers of new markets, it is easy to establish strong brand recognition and customer loyalty.

**Potential Challenges**

*   **High Difficulty of Execution**: Requires deep insight, extraordinary creativity, and the courage to challenge industry traditions.
*   **Organizational Resistance**: Implementing a blue ocean strategy often requires significant adjustments to the company's existing operations, culture, and mindset, which may encounter internal resistance.
*   **Blue Ocean May Turn Red**: Any successful blue ocean will eventually attract imitators and followers, causing the blue ocean to gradually turn red. Therefore, companies need the ability to continuously innovate value.

## Extensions and Connections

*   **Business Model Canvas**: An excellent tool for designing and planning how to transform a blue ocean strategy idea into a viable, profitable business model.
*   **Value Proposition Canvas**: Can help you deeply consider how your new product or service creates value for customers, solves their pain points, and brings gains.
*   **Disruptive Innovation**: Related to but different from Blue Ocean Strategy. Disruptive innovation usually refers to entering the market from the low end or a new foothold by providing simpler, cheaper solutions, and ultimately disrupting existing market leaders. Blue Ocean Strategy is not limited to this; it can occur at any market level.
